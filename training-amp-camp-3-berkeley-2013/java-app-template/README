This is a stub project for developing standalone Spark progras in Java.
It uses Simple Build Tool (sbt), a popular Scala build system that can
also build Java code; however, it would also be easy to use Maven or Ant.

You can run and modify the project as follows:

- To compile your project into a JAR: sbt/sbt package (builds JAR in target/)
- To run main class: sbt/sbt run
- To run main class with arguments: sbt/sbt "run arg1 arg2"
- To change the project name: edit "name" at the top of build.sbt
